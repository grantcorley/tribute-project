<h1>Jane Jacobs: A Tribute</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most influential voice on cities during the last century has been neither a politician, architect, nor even a professional urban planner. Instead, Jane Jacobs, a writer and activist from Scranton, PA, developed theories which challenged the status quo and which have been debated and adopted the world over.</p>

<p>At a time when American planners were committed to bulldozing as much of central cities as possible for freeways, convention centers, and "slum clearance", Jacobs recognized the intrinsic value of finely grained and economically diverse older city neighborhoods, cataloging and celebrating the intricate "sidewalk ballet" that takes place every day on city streets across the world.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>Jacobs (formerly Jane Butzner) settled in New York City with her sister during the Great Depression, eventually purchasing a home on Hudson Street in Greenwhich Village. She took jobs as a freelance writer for several publications in New York, eventually ending up at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, where she began taking assignments about urban planning.</p>

<p>During her time at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, Jacobs began questioning urban planning practices, noting that "development" seemed to end community life on the street. She urged architects and planners to "respect &mdash; in the deepest sense &mdash; strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order."</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Who is this crazy dame?”</p>
    <p class="citation">&mdash; C.D. Jackson, publisher of <i>Fortune</i> magazine </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1961, Jacobs published the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities" target="_blank"><i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i></a>. Generally considered to be the most important book in the history of urban planning theory, <i>Death and Life</i> attacked all conventions of modern planning, going to far as to declare urban planning a "psedudoscience". The book argued for the need for older buildings, challenged conventional thinking on city parks, and declared districts built all-at-once as 'dead on arrival'. It coined the terms "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" target="_blank">social capital</a>", "eyes on the street" (related to safety), and "mixed primary uses". </p>

<p>Upon publication of the book, Jacobs was dismissed by architecture and planning professionals as an amateur, "a militant dame" and a "housewife". Yet, <i>Death and Life</i>, based largely on observations Jacobs honed from paying attention to her own block in Greenwich Village, eventually came to be adoopted as the bible of urban planning concepts far and wide.</p>
