    <h1>Jane Jacobs: A Tribute</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” </p>
</blockquote>


<section id="article-main-content">
<p>The most influential voice on cities during the last century was been neither a politician, an architect, nor even a professional urban planner.</p>

<p> Instead, <strong>Jane Jacobs</strong>, a writer and activist from Scranton, PA, developed and promoted theories on how cities work which challenged the status quo and which have been debated and adopted the world over.</p>

<p>At a time when American planners were committed to bulldozing as much of central cities as possible for freeways, convention centers, and "slum clearance", Jacobs recognized the intrinsic value of finely grained and economically diverse older city neighborhoods, cataloging and celebrating the intricate "sidewalk ballet" that takes place every day on city streets across the world.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>Jacobs (formerly Jane Butzner) settled in New York City with her sister during the Great Depression, eventually purchasing a home on Hudson Street in Greenwich Village. She took jobs as a freelance writer for several publications in New York, eventually ending up at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, where she began taking assignments about urban planning.</p>

<p>During her time at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, Jacobs began questioning urban planning practices, noting that "development" seemed to end community life on the street. She urged architects and planners to "respect &mdash; in the deepest sense &mdash; strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order."</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Who is this crazy dame?”</p>
    <p class="citation">&mdash; C.D. Jackson, publisher of <i>Fortune</i> magazine </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1961, Jacobs published the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities" target="_blank"><i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i></a>. Generally considered to be the most important book in the history of urban planning theory, <i>Death and Life</i> attacked all conventions of modern planning, going to far as to declare urban planning a "psedudoscience". The book argued for the need for older buildings, challenged conventional thinking on city parks, and declared districts built all-at-once as 'dead on arrival'. It coined the terms "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" target="_blank">social capital</a>", "eyes on the street" (related to safety), and "mixed primary uses". </p>

<p>Upon publication of the book, Jacobs was dismissed by architecture and planning professionals as an amateur, "a militant dame" and a "housewife". Yet, <i>Death and Life</i>, based largely on observations Jacobs honed from paying attention to her own block in Greenwich Village, eventually came to be adopted as the bible of urban planning concepts.</p>

    <li>the curse of "border vacuums"</li>
    <li>erosion of cities or attrition of automobiles</li>
  </ul>
    


    <h2>Activism</h2>

<p>Jacobs' strong positions on city planning ultimately brought her into direct confrontation with the City and State of New York, which had plans for massive urban renewal projects in her neighborhood, including an expansion of the Lower Manhattan Expressway. Jacobs lead the fight against this freeway project for a decade, and was eventually arrested at a public hearing during which the crowd charged the state and destroyed the stenographer's notes.</p>

<p>The decade-long battle between Jacobs and New York planning titan Robert Moses has become the stuff of legend, and has been chronicled in several books and films, including the 2016 documentary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/citizen-jane-battle-for-the-city-review.html" target="_blank"><i>Citizen Jane: Battle for the City</i></a></p>


<h2>Later Years</h2>

<p>After her arrest, Jacobs and her family moved to Toronto.</p> 

<p>Although she was exhausted by her battles with the New York City government, she was roped into fighting another freeway expansion project, this time against the planned Spadina Expressway in her newly adopted city. Jacobs did not lead this fight but was a trusted ally. The Spadina Expresway through downtown was eventually defeated.</p>
    
<p>Jacobs also worked on the revitalization of Tornoto's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence,_Toronto" target="_blank">St. Lawrence</a> neighborhood, opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of Metro Toronto (she lost that battle), and was also influential in the development of modern Vancouver.</p>


<h2>Legacy &amp; Works</h2>

<p>Jane Jacobs died in 2006.</p>

<p>Her <i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> continues to be the most influential book in the study of cities and urban planning. However, Jacobs wrote several other books, including <i>The Economy of Cities</i>, <i>The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle Over Sovereignty</i>, <i>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</i>, and <i>Systems of Survival</i>.</p>

<p>Jacobs' last book, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/12/did-jane-jacobs-predict-the-rise-of-trump/509987/"><i>Dark Age Ahead</i></a>, published in 2004, argued that North American civilization shows a sprial of decline similar to the collapse of the Roman Empire. In it, she predicted a coming worldwide populist political backlash that coincided with an increasing distrust of politicians, entrenched segregation, xenophobia, and an attrition of the middle class.</p>

<p>Jacobs is considered to be one of the primary influences of the <a href="https://www.cnu.org/resources/what-new-urbanism" target="_blank">New Urbanist</a> movement.</p>

    <h2>Criticisms</h2>

    <p>Although "Saint Jane" is regarded as a nearly infallible figure in many circles, her ideas have nonetheless been the subject of legitimate critique over the decades.</p>
    
    <h3>Racism</h3>
    <p>The primary <a href="https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2016/10/jane-jacobss-tunnel-vision/" target="_blank">criticism</a> leveled against Jacobs is that she left a lot out. That is, she did not consider issues directly outside of her own experience as a middle-class white woman. As a result, she was largely blind to the issues of racism and race dynamics in her analyses. This means that she did not consider powerful forces such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html" target="_blank">redlining,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting" target="_blank">blockbusting</a>, and racially restrictive covenants in the shaping of urban neighborhoods and their suburban counterparts, all at a time when millions of black Americans were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)" target="_blank">migrating</a> to Northern and Western cities to find work and escape the conditions of the Jim Crow South.</p>

    <h3>Gentrification</h3>
    <p>Another issue overlooked in Jacobs' worldview was gentrification, possibly because at the time of her writing, middle-class Americans were moving in droves from central cities to the suburbs. Today, the economically and racially diverse neighborhood of Greenwich Village celebrated as a bustling melting pot in her works during the 1950s and 60s has morphed into an <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/07/the-death-of-new-york-city-gentrification/" target="_blank">exclusive enclave inhabited primarily by the wealthy</a>. While it seems likely that Jacobs would disapprove of the monoculture this neighborhood &mdash; and others across the country &mdash; have become, she did not forsee it as an issue in her time.</p>

    <h3>Poverty and Public Services</h3>
    <p>Jacobs' criticism of the design of public housing ignored the realities of the slum tenements that this housing replaced, and has been used as a justification to abandon or reduce public housing efforts, with no Plan B.</p>

    <h3>Overgeneralizations</h3>

    <p>Cities are complicated organisms, and although Jacobs recognized this in her writings, she has nonetheless been critiqued for overly simplifying and generalizing what can be the random nature of big cities, their people, their politics, and a million other facets. In the process, "Jane Jacobs" has arguably become a sloppy shorthand for good urbanism, but devoid of critical thought.</p>
