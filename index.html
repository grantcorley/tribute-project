<h1>Jane Jacobs: A Tribute</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most influential voice on cities during the last century has been neither a politician, architect, nor even a professional urban planner. Instead, Jane Jacobs, a writer and activist from Scranton, PA, developed theories which challenged the status quo and which have been debated and adopted the world over.</p>

<p>At a time when American planners were committed to bulldozing as much of central cities as possible for freeways, convention centers, and "slum clearance", Jacobs recognized the intrinsic value of finely grained and economically diverse older city neighborhoods, cataloging and celebrating the intricate "sidewalk ballet" that takes place every day on city streets across the world.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>Jacobs (formerly Jane Butzner) settled in New York City with her sister during the Great Depression, eventually purchasing a home on Hudson Street in Greenwich Village. She took jobs as a freelance writer for several publications in New York, eventually ending up at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, where she began taking assignments about urban planning.</p>

<p>During her time at <i>Architectural Forum</i>, Jacobs began questioning urban planning practices, noting that "development" seemed to end community life on the street. She urged architects and planners to "respect &mdash; in the deepest sense &mdash; strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order."</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Who is this crazy dame?”</p>
    <p class="citation">&mdash; C.D. Jackson, publisher of <i>Fortune</i> magazine </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1961, Jacobs published the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities" target="_blank"><i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i></a>. Generally considered to be the most important book in the history of urban planning theory, <i>Death and Life</i> attacked all conventions of modern planning, going to far as to declare urban planning a "psedudoscience". The book argued for the need for older buildings, challenged conventional thinking on city parks, and declared districts built all-at-once as 'dead on arrival'. It coined the terms "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" target="_blank">social capital</a>", "eyes on the street" (related to safety), and "mixed primary uses". </p>

<p>
        
    Upon publication of the book, Jacobs was dismissed by architecture and planning professionals as an amateur, "a militant dame" and a "housewife". Yet, <i>Death and Life</i>, based largely on observations Jacobs honed from paying attention to her own block in Greenwich Village, eventually came to be adopted as the bible of urban planning concepts.</p>

    <h2>Activism</h2>

<p>Jacobs' strong positions on city planning ultimately brought her into direct confrontation with the City and State of New York, which had plans for massive urban renewal projects in her neighborhood, including an expansion of the Lower Manhattan Expressway. Jacobs lead the fight against this freeway project for a decade, and was eventually arrested at a public hearing during which the crowd charged the state and destroyed the stenographer's notes.</p>

<p>The decade-long battle between Jacobs and New York planning titan Robert Moses has become the stuff of legend, and has been chronicled in several books and films, including the 2016 documentary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/citizen-jane-battle-for-the-city-review.html" target="_blank"><i>Citizen Jane: Battle for the City</i></a></p>


<h2>Later Years</h2>

<p>After her arrest, Jacobs and her family moved to Toronto. Although she was tired of fighting the New York City government, she once again eventually became embroiled in a fight with the leaders of her new city over the planned Spadina Expressway through downtown Toronto, which was eventually defeated. Jacobs also worked on the revitalization of Tornoto's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence,_Toronto" target="_blank">St. Lawrence</a> neighborhood, opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of Metro Toronto (she lost that battle), and was also influential in the development of modern Vancouver.</p>


<h2>Legacy and Works</h2>

<p>Jane Jacobs died in 2006.</p>

<p>Her <i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> continues to be the most influential book in the study of cities and urban planning. However, Jacobs wrote several other books, including <i>The Economy of Cities</i>, <i>The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle Over Sovereignty</i>, <i>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</i>, and <i>Systems of Survival</i>.</p>

<p>Jacobs' last book, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/12/did-jane-jacobs-predict-the-rise-of-trump/509987/"><i>Dark Age Ahead</i></a>, published in 2004, argued that North American civilization shows a sprial of decline similar to the collapse of the Roman Empire. In it, she predicted a coming worldwide populist political backlash that coincided with an increasing distrust of politicians, entrenched segregation, xenophobia, and an attrition of the middle class.</p>

<p>Jacobs is considered to be one of the primary influences of the <a href="https://www.cnu.org/resources/what-new-urbanism" target="_blank">New Urbanist</a> movement.</p>
